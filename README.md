# Evolutionary-game
This repository presents a cyclical evolutionary game using the replicator model coded in R. In this case, the biological model *Uta stansburiana* is used, which has genetically determined phenotypes/strategies associated with males, who are monogamous-cooperative, dominant, and opportunistic, and these follow a cyclical dynamic similar to the Rock, Paper, Scissors game.
